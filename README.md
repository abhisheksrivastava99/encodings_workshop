# Interactive Text Encodings in NLP Workshop

A comprehensive, interactive Jupyter notebook-based workshop designed to teach various text encoding techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This workshop provides hands-on examples, visualizations, and interactive demonstrations to help users understand how text is transformed into numerical representations for machine learning models.

## Overview

Text encoding is a fundamental process in NLP that transforms human language into numerical formats that machine learning algorithms can understand. This workshop covers the entire spectrum of encoding techniques from basic approaches to advanced methods, with a strong focus on practical examples and interactive exploration.

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is divided into multiple sequential Jupyter notebooks covering different aspects of text encoding:

1. **Notebook 1 (encodings_workshop_1.ipynb)**: Introduction and Basic Implementation
   - Core concepts and importance of text encoding in NLP
   - Building encoding methods from scratch (One-Hot, Bag of Words, TF-IDF)
   - Interactive explorations of basic encoding techniques

2. **Notebook 2 (encodings_workshop_2.ipynb)**: Interactive Concept Explanation, Advanced Implementation and Data Flow Visualization
   - Deep dive into encoding concepts with interactive visualizations
   - Integration with popular NLP libraries
   - Visualization of data transformations in the encoding pipeline

3. **Notebook 3 (encodings_workshop_3.ipynb)**: User Interaction
   - Interactive workshop to experiment with different encoding parameters
   - Visual comparisons of encoding methods
   - Real-time exploration of how parameter changes affect results

4. **Notebook 4 (encoding_workshop_4.ipynb)**: Challenges, Edge Cases, and Conclusion
   - Common challenges in text encoding (OOV words, rare terms, multilingual text)
   - Solutions for handling edge cases
   - Summary of key concepts and further reading resources

## Features

- **Hands-on Implementation**: Build text encoding methods from scratch to understand core concepts
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore encoding techniques through dynamic, visual representations
- **Parameter Experimentation**: Adjust encoding parameters and see results in real-time
- **Practical Challenges**: Learn to handle real-world text encoding issues
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From basic one-hot encoding to advanced word embeddings
